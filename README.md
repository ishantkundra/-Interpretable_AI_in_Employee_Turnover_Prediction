# Explainable AI for Employee Turnover Prediction: LIME vs SHAP

This project explores **interpretable AI techniques** to explain the predictions of a Random Forest model trained on employee attrition data. Using **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations), the study compares local and global feature attributions and analyzes model fairness with respect to **age** and **gender**.

Developed as part of **CSCE 689: Human-AI Interaction** at **Texas A&M University**.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Train a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict employee attrition  
- Apply LIME and SHAP for model interpretation  
- Visualize feature influences and compare explanations  
- Evaluate fairness of predictions across **age** and **gender**  
- Compare **execution time** and effectiveness of LIME vs SHAP  

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Data preprocessing & encoding of categorical features  
- Split: 70% train / 30% test  
- RandomForestClassifier from `sklearn`  
- Feature importance measured via:
  - **LIME**: individual, local explanations  
  - **SHAP**: global feature impact overview  

---

## 📊 Key Results

- **LIME**: Explained individual predictions (e.g., influence of `City`, `Education`, `JoiningYear`)  
- **SHAP**: Global feature importance showed `JoiningYear` and `PaymentTier` as key predictors  
- **Bias Analysis**:
  - Higher attrition prediction for <30 age group and females  
  - Calibration curve issues for older employees and females  
- **Time Comparison**:
  - LIME: ~0.23 seconds (fast, instance-level)  
  - SHAP: ~13.8 seconds (slower, global-level)

## 🧠 Insights

| Technique | Type   | Speed     | Best For                  |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------------------|
| LIME      | Local  | Very Fast | Real-time decisions       |
| SHAP      | Global | Slower    | Audits, fairness analysis |

Both are **model-agnostic**, powerful tools for explainability.
